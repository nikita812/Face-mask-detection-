# Face-mask-detection

As we all know, covid-19 has hit the world badly hence making face masks a crucial  part of everyday life for safety of ourselves and others.

So, I made a model using convolution neural networks to classify people are masked or not  and open computer vision for  detecting if people are wearing masks in crowded places in video streams.
